          <br>
          <br>
       Molly was born in December 2010.  The exact date isn't known, so we let her share a birthday with Karen, December 19.  I adopted her from Petsmart when she was 3 months old - she was living in a cat resuce!  She came to live with me in March 2011. </p>

            <li> Molly likes walks, but only for a short time.</li>
            <li> Molly's favorite game in her younger days was tug-of-war.  She was quite fierce!</li>

<h4 class="subtitleunder">Fred's History:</h4>
        Fred was born on May 5, 2022 on a farm in Central California.  There were many dogs, up to 40.  There were several litters and all the pups in Fred's litter started wtih "F" when they took them to the rescue.  Fred was the cutest - such a sweet face.  The rescue was BARC (Benevolent Animal Rescue Center) in Cherry Valley.</p>

            <h4 class="subtitleunder">Percy's History:</h4>
            Percy was found near the railroad tracks between Redlands and Moreno Valley.  He was dirty, with matted long hair.  He got shaved and was an adorable little happy gentleman.  The vet thinks he's between a year and 18 months, so his birthday will be March 17, 2023. Although initially planning on helping him find a home, he made my heart so happy and gave Fred a play buddy.  He is the newest addition to the family.</p>
